In these cases, a handful of tests is usually enough to provide confidence that the software is working as expected. In the real world, however, you might be developing a complex piece of sofware to implement an entirely new algorithm, or model. In certain cases it might not even be clear what the expected outcome is meant to be. Things can be particularly challenging when the software is involves a stochastic element.\n",
