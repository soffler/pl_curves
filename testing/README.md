The episodes `01_testing.html` and `02_fixtures.html` (and their supporting material
under the `arrays` directory) were developed by Matt Williams and are available at 
[their website](https://milliams.com/courses/software_engineering_best_practices/).

The remaining material was developed by Lester Hedges and is available at
[Chrys Woods's website](http://chryswoods.com/python_and_data/testing/README.html).
